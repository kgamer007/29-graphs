## Submission Instructions
  * Work in a fork of this repository
  * Work in a branch on your fork called `lab-29`
  * Submit a pull request to your repository
  * Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
  * Set up Travis CI and update your repo to utilize the [Travis CI Github app](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci). *Use the free instsallation.*
  * Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on Canvas  

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
* Structure your Graphs lab similar to how lecture code is scaffolded. Refer to the [backend lab scaffold template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d25/tree/master/00-BACKEND-lab-scaffold-template).

#### Feature Tasks 
* **Implement a breadth-first traversal of a graph**. 
* Review the provided code for Djikstra's algorithm and write comments on what each line of code is doing. If you need to research other articles or documentation to understand Djikstra's algorithm or the code (i.e. you had to read the docs for the Priority Queue module that the code uses), **please cite that documentation with links in your comments**. 

#### Tests
* Write three test assertions for your breadth-first traversal 
 

#### Documentation  
Add your Travis badge to the top of your README (even if your build is failing), and describe what a graph is. Include the Big Oh time and space complexity of your breadth-first traversal. 

#### Stretch Goals
* Implemenent a graph as an edge list. 
* Implement a graph as an adjacency matrix.
