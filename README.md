describe what a graph is. Include the Big Oh time and space complexity of your breadth-first traversal.

## Graph lab
A graph is a non-linear data structure (basically no hierarchy) that can be looked at as a collection of points made up of vertices and lines named edges. 

Which in relation to our big oh time and space complexity of BFT...
Time: O(v + e)
Space: O(v + e)
